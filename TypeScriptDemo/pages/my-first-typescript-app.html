        <h2>Creating a TypeScript Project</h2>
        <p>
            Once you have the base tooling installed, you can make your first TypeScript project.  From within Visual Studio, it's as simple as creating a new project and using the HTML Application
            with TypeScript template found under "Templates" -> "Other Languages" -> "TypeScript".
