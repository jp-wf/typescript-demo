        <h2>Necessary Tools</h2>
        <p>
            There are a number of routes you could go to get started working in TypeScript.  Since it was originally developed by Microsoft this presentation will outline their tooling for getting
            up and going. The first basic tool you'll need is the IDE to work in, you can choose either Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition or Visual Studio Code.  Both of these products are 
            available from the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Downloads</a> page.            
        </p>
        <p>
            These products support TypeScript out of the box, but it is a good idea to make sure you have the latest version, which can be obtained from the following link:
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48593" target="_blank">TypeScript for Visual Studio 2015</a>.
            The development of TypeScript in the past few years has been very active and a lot of the features that were added in the 2.0 version really make working with the language much easier. 
            That being the case, you'll want to make sure you running the latest stable version.

        <h2>Other Recommended Tooling</h2>
        <p>
            The rise of package management systems has greatly eased intregration of external dependencies in projects in the past decade or so.  In the javascript space, no system is more prominent 
            than <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">NPM</a>.  To get the most out of TypeScript development, it is 
            probably more of a requirement than a recommendation to install these products. Node.js is available for most major platforms.  It
            comes with a simple version of NPM built-in, but the full version can be installed via the following command:
        </p>
        <div class="console-wrapper">
            <code id="code-install-npm">npm install npm -g</code>
        </div>        
        <p>
            Once you have Node.js and NPM installed, you can leverage a lot of tooling to aid
            in TypeScript development.  There are many module systems, build tools and testing tools, and Type Definitions for existing Javascript libraries the can be retrieved via NPM.  Additionally,
            if you create a package.json file for your project using &lsquo;npm init&rsquo; you can interact with packages using a dynamic user interface built into Visual Studio.

        <h2>Other Recommended Tooling (Cont'd)</h2>
        <p>Having Node.js and NPM installed gives access to a plethora of development and testing tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of examples are outlined below:</p>      
        <br />
        <p>            
            <a class="logo-img" href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">
                <img src="../img/gulp-text.png" />
            </a>
            <br />
            For task automation, a great tool is <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a>.  This tool allows for file concatenation, packaging, linting, compiling sass, 
            watching for file changes, minifying and uglifying code among many other tasks.  Furthermore, Visual Studio has a window called the Task Runner Explorer, which allows for running
            and managing Gulp tasks directly through the IDE. 
        </p>

            <a class="logo-img" href="https://jasmine.github.io/" target="_blank">
                <img src="../img/jasmine-logo.png" />
            </a>
            <br />
            <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/" target="_blank">Jasmine</a> is a behavior-driven testing framework that was developed for JavaScript.  Since TypeScript transpiles down to JavaScript, it works equally
            well for testing your TypeScript code.  The testing syntax can be supported by importing the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/jasmine" target="_blank">@types/jasmine</a> module from NPM.  
            Jasmine is covered in more detail later in this presentation.
