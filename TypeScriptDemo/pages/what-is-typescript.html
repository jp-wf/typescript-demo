        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> is a language that was developed by Microsoft and first released in 2012.  It is a superset of the javascript language,
            but it was influenced greatly by C# and Java.  The lead developer was also the lead developer for the C# language.  The goal of <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> is to provide a language that scaled
            better with large enterprise applications than just a raw javascript.  
        </p>
        <p>    
            To that end, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> was developed to contain many of the core concepts found in modern object oriented
            languages.   Some big corporations began using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> to implement their enterprise applications and libraries and caused for the rapid rise and evolution of the language.
            Notably, the use of <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> as the implementation language of <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular 2</a> by Google has caused for increased adoption of <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>.

        <h2>What Is It?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> is a superset language on top of basic javascript.  That means valid javascript is also valid <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>.  <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> code is transpiled into javascript using the
            <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html" target="_blank" title="TypeScript Compiler">TypeScript Compiler (tsc)</a>, which is also implemented in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>.  The TypeScript Compiler takes in configuration values (tsconfig.json)
            to determine how to transpile the code.  The <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html" target="_blank" title="TypeScript Compiler">tsc</a> can target different flavors of javascript (ECMAScript5, ECMAScript2015, EMCAScript6, etc) and
            also supports all the major modules formats used in javascript programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to providing a more object oriented programming language, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> also supports a declaration system that allows the use of pure javascript libraries
            within <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> solutions.  This allows users to utilize existing javascript frameworks seamlessly within their <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> applications.
