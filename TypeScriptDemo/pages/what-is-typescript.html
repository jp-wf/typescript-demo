        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> is a language that was developed by Microsoft and first released in 2012.  It is a superset of the JavaScript language,
            but it was influenced greatly by C# and Java.  The lead developer was also the lead developer for the C# language.  The goal of TypeScript is to provide a language that scaled
            better with large enterprise applications than just a raw JavaScript.  
        </p>
        <p>    
            To that end, TypeScript was developed to contain many of the core concepts found in modern object oriented
            languages.   Some big corporations began using TypeScript to implement their enterprise applications and libraries and caused for the rapid rise and evolution of the language.
            Notably, the use of TypeScript as the implementation language of <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular 2</a> by Google has caused for increased adoption of TypeScript.

        <h2>What Is It?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> is a superset language on top of basic javascript.  That means valid javascript is also valid TypeScript.  TypeScript code is transpiled into javascript using the
            <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html" target="_blank" title="TypeScript Compiler">TypeScript Compiler (tsc)</a>, which is also implemented in TypeScript.  The TypeScript Compiler takes in configuration values (tsconfig.json)
            to determine how to transpile the code.  The TypeScript Compiler can target different flavors of JavaScript (ECMAScript5, ECMAScript2015, EMCAScript6, etc) and
            also supports all the major modules formats used in JavaScript programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to providing a more object oriented programming language, TypeScript also supports a declaration system that allows the use of pure javascript libraries
            within TypeScript solutions.  This allows users to utilize existing javascript frameworks seamlessly within their TypeScript applications.
